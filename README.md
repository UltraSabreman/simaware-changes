## simaware-express

---
This is a fork of the original [SimAware](https://github.com/maiuswong/simaware-express) codebase. My intention is to merge the pull requests present on the orignal repo, as I find them to be good idea, and implement my own tweaks. To be ran on my own local server.

Short Term TODO:
* ~~Merge [MardilB's](https://github.com/MardilB) Pull Requests.~~
* Handle some of the issues on main project on my end.
* Add more TODOs

Long Term TODO:
* Add option for globe map rendering.
* Parse filed flightplans and display the routes on selected aircraft.
